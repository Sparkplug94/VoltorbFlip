To Do:
Optimize OCR - convolve against random single well-chosen kernel, the number I get for each digit is unique - 1 convolution instead of 10
Improve automatic playing algorithm -- take into account possibilities for each row given the sum (can do parity checks on sums because of even vs. odd sums)
Parity Checks can improve FoM algorithm (2 tiles and 3 tiles have different parity - odd or even
